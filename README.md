# Welcome to the cypho.io Sources Challenge!
Cypho invites you to contribute to our platform by identifying, analyzing, and integrating new data sources. These tasks are part of a reward-based system, where you are evaluated on the quality, relevance, and technical depth of their proposals. Below are the categories for source integration tasks:

<h3> Prize: best score wins $200!</h3>

## Getting Started
To participate in this challenge, you are required to submit proposals that address specific categories of source integration. Each proposal should include the following:
- Source Identification: Clearly specify the type of source (e.g., community channels, data repositories, or analysis tools). This is the most critical stage and will significantly affect your score.
- Data Analysis Methods: Explain the techniques for processing and analyzing data from the source.
- Expected Outcomes: Highlight the actionable insights or value the integration will bring to Cyphoâ€™s platform.

Source Identification phase is the most important and will affect your score significantly. The remaining sections, like analysis methods and expected outcomes, will help you achieve the highest possible score.

### Community Monitoring
Proposals in this category focus on identifying and integrating community channels (e.g., Telegram Channels, Discord Communities, BlackHat Forums etc.) as sources and propose methods for analyzing messages to extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), malicious URLs, or mentions of target. Specify how the data will be processed, e.g., keyword matching, natural language processing, or sentiment analysis. Provide examples of actionable intelligence, such as identifying a breach or leaked credentials.

### Search and Data Discovery
Proposals in this category focus on leveraging platforms and tools (e.g., Postman Public API Search, Pastebin, Any.run Sandbox Analysis) as sources and explain how these sources can be searched or monitored for:
- Exposed credentials or secrets in public APIs.
- Sensitive information or documents related to target.
- Patterns or signals suggesting potential breaches, such as indicate mentions of sensitive assets, suspicious activity logs, or unexplained data leaks.
